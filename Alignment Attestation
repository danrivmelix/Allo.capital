# The Mensarius Oath ReFi Alignment Attestation


This document articulates why we believe Regenerative Finance (ReFi) principles inherently align with and reinforce the values expressed in the Mensarius Oath.
Integrity & ReFi
The Mensarius Oath calls for investing with integrity that benefits broader systems while avoiding harm. ReFi exemplifies this by designing financial mechanisms that specifically repair ecological damage and regenerate natural systems rather than extracting value at their expense. By internalizing externalities that traditional finance often ignores, ReFi represents integrity in financial action.
Excellence & ReFi
ReFi pioneers are establishing new professional standards that transcend profit maximization by measuring success through verified positive impact. This multidimensional excellence—technical, financial, and ecological—embodies the Oath's commitment to setting exemplary ethical benchmarks in finance.
Fairness & ReFi
ReFi mechanisms directly confront the "tragedy of the commons" and other coordination failures by creating markets and incentives that fairly value previously unaccounted commons resources. By preventing the socialization of environmental costs while privatizing gains, ReFi addresses one of the most fundamental fairness challenges in economic systems.
Neutrality & ReFi
The blockchain-based transparency inherent to many ReFi systems enables credible neutrality in resource allocation. By moving environmental markets and impact verification onchain, ReFi creates systems where rules apply equally to all participants regardless of size or influence, aligning with the Oath's neutrality principle.
Respect & ReFi
ReFi explicitly acknowledges and respects the eight forms of capital—particularly living capital (natural resources and biodiversity) and spiritual capital (purpose and meaning)—that the Mensarius Oath recognizes. This respect manifests in designing systems that value ecosystem services and community wellbeing rather than treating them as externalities.
Transparency & ReFi
Through verifiable impact claims, open-source methodologies, and blockchain-based monitoring, ReFi embodies the Oath's transparency principle. ReFi projects typically provide unprecedented visibility into both financial flows and the real-world impacts they generate—transparency that extends beyond traditional financial reporting.
Open Systems & ReFi
ReFi inherently balances open innovation with practical protection of intellectual property through its emphasis on "open source, closed data" models. This approach enables collaborative advancement of regenerative mechanisms while protecting the competitive advantages of individual implementations.
Growth & ReFi
ReFi represents an approach to financial growth that acknowledges planetary boundaries and social foundations. By designing for true durability rather than short-term expansion, ReFi embodies the sustainable, mindful growth that the Mensarius Oath envisions.

Attestation
We attest that building, investing in, and advancing Regenerative Finance capabilities represents a practical implementation of the Mensarius Oath in the onchain ecosystem. By supporting ReFi initiatives, professionals demonstrate their commitment to the values of integrity, excellence, fairness, neutrality, respect, transparency, open systems, and holistic growth outlined in the Oath.
