# The Mensarius Oath ReFi Alignment Attestation

---

* *Mensarius Oath: “An ethical code of conduct for venture capitalists and other finance professionals that is designed to foster positive outcomes for humanity” (Founder Institute, Inc.).*

* *Regenerative Finance (ReFi): An emerging field that uses blockchain and decentralized financial mechanisms to fund ecological regeneration and positive social impact rather than resource extraction.*

This document articulates why we believe ReFi principles align with the values expressed in the Mensarius Oath.

## **ReFi Integrity** 

ReFi designs financial mechanisms based on repairing rather than extracting value at the expense of ecological and natural systems. The Mensarius Oath calls for investing with integrity that benefits broader systems while avoiding harm. By internalizing externalities that traditional finance often ignores, ReFi represents integrity in financial action.

## **ReFi and Excellence**

ReFi pioneers are establishing new professional standards that transcend profit maximization by measuring success through verified positive impact. The technical, financial and ecological multidimension embodies the Mensarius Oath’s commitment to setting ethical benchmarks in finance.

## **Fairness and Neutrality** 

ReFi confronts coordination failures by creating markets and incentives that fairly value previously unaccounted commons resources. The blockchain-based transparency inherent to many ReFi systems enables credible neutrality in resource allocation. By moving environmental markets and impact verification onchain, ReFi creates systems where rules apply equally to all participants regardless of size or influence, aligning with the Oath's fariness and neutrality principles.

## **Respect & ReFi**

ReFi acknowledges the eight forms of capital that the Mensarius Oath recognizes with particular focus on living capital (natural resources and biodiversity) and spiritual capital (purpose and meaning). This respect manifests in designing systems that value ecosystem services and community wellbeing rather than treating them as externalities.

## **Transparency and Open Systems with ReFi**

ReFi embodies the Oath's transparency principle through open-source methodologies (open source, closed data) and blockchain based monitoring. ReFi projects typically provide visibility into both financial flows and the real-world impacts they generate. A balance is created with open innovation  and practical protection of intellectual property. This approach enables collaborative advancement of regenerative mechanisms while protecting the competitive advantages of individual implementations.

## **Growth - ReFi**
By designing for true durability rather than short-term expansion, ReFi embodies the sustainable, mindful growth that the Mensarius Oath envisions.

## **Attestation**

*We attest that building, investing in, and advancing Regenerative Finance capabilities represents a practical implementation of the Mensarius Oath in the onchain ecosystem. By supporting ReFi initiatives, professionals demonstrate their commitment to the values of integrity, excellence, fairness, neutrality, respect, transparency, open systems, and holistic growth outlined in the Oath.*
